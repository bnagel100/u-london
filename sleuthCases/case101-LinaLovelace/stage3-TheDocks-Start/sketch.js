Case 101 - The Case of Lina Lovelace
Stage 3 - The Docks

You’ve followed Lina down to the docks. She sure frequents some classy places.
Okay let’s see who she’s meeting down there.

Identify Lina by drawing a Deep Sky Blue filled rectangle around her.
She’s the woman in the red dress of course.

Identify the heavy-set man in the fishing overalls by drawing a Royal Blue filled
rectangle around him.

Identify the man in the striped top by drawing a Cornflower Blue filled rectangle around
him.

The rectangles should cover the targets as accurately as possible without
including anything else.

Use X11 colours. You can find a reference table at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors.

There are many possible ways of investigating this case, but you
should use ONLY the following commands:

  rect()
  fill() Use r,g,b values between 0 and 255. Set alpha to 100 for some opacity.
