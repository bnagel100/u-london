201 - The case of Judge Hopper
Stage 3 - The dressing room

Officer: 9645752
CaseNum: 201-2-35694731-9645752

No sooner do you enter the lobby of the Cobol Theatre than the sound of gunshots leads you running towards the backstage area. You head towards a swinging door, the star dressing room. Sure enough you find a series of bullet holes peppered across the mirror. You are about to turn round and resume your chase when you notice a familiar pattern in the holes. Frantically you grab some lipstick from the dresser and draw on the mirror.

Use the vertex function to complete the pattern.
